A list in no particular order of outstanding development features, both in-progress and planned:

- Sensible default QC parameters to allow automated end-to-end execution with little-to-no required user intervention

- Integration of additional tools and scripts:

2. Inference of recombination events (e.g. Gubbins, CFML)
3. Phylogenetic inference of lateral gene transfer events using [`rspr`](https://github.com/cwhidden/rspr)
4. Inference of concerted gain and loss of genes and mobile genetic elements using [`the Community Coevolution Model`](https://github.com/beiko-lab/evolCCM)
5. Partner applications for analysis and visualization of phylogenetic distributions of genes and MGEs and gene-order clustering (For example, [Coeus](https://github.com/JTL-lab/Coeus)).

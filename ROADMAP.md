A list in no particular order of outstanding development features, both in-progress and planned:

- Integration of additional tools and scripts:

1. Phylogenetic inference of lateral gene transfer events using [`rspr`](https://github.com/cwhidden/rspr)
2. Partner applications for analysis and visualization of phylogenetic distributions of genes and MGEs and gene-order clustering (For example, [Coeus](https://github.com/JTL-lab/Coeus)).
